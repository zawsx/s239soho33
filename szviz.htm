<h2>  Importance of entertainment and licensed activities</h2>
<p><br />
  The evening and night-time economy (ENTE) in Westminster is the largest concentration of its kind <br />
  in the UK. 
  It is significantly bigger than the ENTEs of Edinburgh, Birmingham and Manchester <br />
  Its diversity and degree of concentration of entertainment in the West End are unique.<br />
  ENTE activities equate to 23% of all employment in Westminster and 13% of all sales revenue<br />
  In 2013 the economic output of the ENTE in Westminster was 7.7 billion, 220,000 people <br />
  employed in nearly 11,000 businesses<br />
  The number of drinks, entertainment and food led businesses which make up the 'core' ENTE grew <br />
  by 24% between 2003 and 2013, sales revenue increasing by 28% to 2.7 billion<br />
  ENTE activity is not distributed evenly across Westminster, it's highly concentrated in the West End <br />
  Cumulative Impact Area (CIA)<br />
  West End CIA comprises just 4.5% of the local land area of Westminster yet it contains nearly 20% <br />
  of all ENTE activity and over 10% of all Westminster economic activity. The WE CIA includes <br />
  Soho, south of Shaftesbury Avenue and Covent Garden<br />
  Compared to other CIAs; Edgware Rd is 0.4% of the area of Westminster and 1.8% of its ENTE <br />
  activity. Queensway/Bayswater contains 0.6% of Westminster's land use and contributes 2.0% of <br />
  its ENTE activity<br />
  Growth in licensed premises in Westminster<br />
  In the nineties and early years of this decade - the numbers, capacity, hours of operation of <br />
  premises licensed for sale of alcohol or entertainment or as night cafes increased very rapidly - <br />
  particularly in the West End <br />
  The total number of liquor licences in Westminster increased by nearly 400 (16%) from 1991 to <br />
  2002 rising to 2927<br />
  The number of licences for pubs and bars increased by 43% to 1468 with 538 additional licences <br />
  being granted between 1991 and 2002<br />
  The number of public entertainment licences (i.e. music, music and dancing etc) in the West End <br />
  more than doubled from 84 in 1992 to 184 in 2002 - 121 of these closing at 03.00 or later <br />
  In 2002, premises in WE CIA with entertainment licences could accommodate 80,690 people<br />
  In  2010 total number of licensed premises in Westminster increased to 3149, an increase of 6.4% <br />
  in 3 years. This has stabilised with 3134 licensed premises in October 2015<br />
  Pressures and impacts<br />
  Many streets in Soho have night time pedestrian flows of over 40,000 people, with flows of 7,000 <br />
  an hour.<br />
  Soho, Leicester Sq and Shaftesbury Ave have substantially higher pedestrian flows at night than in <br />
  the daytime<br />

  Public nuisance <br />
  • Noise complaints associated with licensed premises is significantly higher in all CIAs compared <br />
  to other areas of Westminster<br />
  • Overall, levels of noise in the West End CIA are high with night time noise at an average <br />
  (background) level is 45 decibels<br />
  • This is a level liable to induce some disturbance of sleep without any additional noise incidents<br />
  • The cumulative impact of background night time noise generated by people in the West End is <br />
  such that it can amount to a public nuisance - even without the additional noise that arises from <br />
  bad behaviour or disorder<br />

  Cumulative Impact Areas <br />
  In parts of Westminster the growth, type and density of licensed premises is such that it causes <br />
  problems of nuisance and disorder<br />
  'Cumulative impact' is defined as the potential impact on the promotion of the licensing objectives  <br />
  of a significant number of licensed premises concentrated in one area<br />
  Licensing objectives :  prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, prevention of public <br />
  nuisance, protection of children from harm <br />
